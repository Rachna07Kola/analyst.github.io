    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a Business Analytics graduate student and University of North Texas graduate I hold Bachelors degrees in Commerce and Computer Applications. My academic records present myself as a student who maintained a 4.0 GPA during my undergraduate studies and now earns a 3.5 GPA because I combine this achievement with practical knowledge in data analytics and enterprise technology and reporting systems. I use Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI in combination with my capabilities in financial and ERP platforms including SAP, Oracle NetSuite and Microsoft Dynamics 365. My combination of strategic thinking and creative decision-making arises when I mentor students through social outreach activities and leadership roles in entrepreneurship events and successful creative projects. My approach to dealing with challenges includes discipline along with precision and collaborative temperaments since I swim nationally and participate in the UNT Business Analytics Club activities. My portfolio provides an integrated perspective of my development which brings together business intelligence capabilities with technical expertise and strong value-driven approaches.</p>
