## Business Analyst Portfolio

This website contains my personal Business Analyst portfolio which uses HTML & CSS to build a platform hosted through GitHub Pages.

The platform functions as an organized platform for showcasing my business analytics development process through combining curiosity with skill and data with decision processes. I use this platform to present information about my academic activities as well as my technology skills and project work coupled with my analytical capabilities in uniting quantitative data with storytelling.

##  About Me

As a Business Analytics graduate student and University of North Texas graduate I hold Bachelors degrees in Commerce and Computer Applications. My academic records present myself as a student who maintained a 4.0 GPA during my undergraduate studies and now earns a 3.5 GPA because I combine this achievement with practical knowledge in data analytics and enterprise technology and reporting systems. I use Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI in combination with my capabilities in financial and ERP platforms including SAP, Oracle NetSuite and Microsoft Dynamics 365. My combination of strategic thinking and creative decision-making arises when I mentor students through social outreach activities and leadership roles in entrepreneurship events and successful creative projects. My approach to dealing with challenges includes discipline along with precision and collaborative temperaments since I swim nationally and participate in the UNT Business Analytics Club activities. My portfolio provides an integrated perspective of my development which brings together business intelligence capabilities with technical expertise and strong value-driven approaches.
